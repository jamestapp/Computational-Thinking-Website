                <h3>Learing Reflections</h3>
                <h4>Study Skills</h4>
                <p>CMT119 has been an excellent reintroduction to formal learning after a long break. My ability to study has been revitalised, reintroducing referencing, note taking, and an independent approach to learning. As a consequence, in future modules I will be able to learn more easily and more effectively.</p>
                <h4>Web Design</h4>
                <p>During this module, I have learned a lot about web design through use of HTML and CSS. Specifically how to design and host a static website, as well as how to structure and style it in a manner that I choose. This is a crucial skill when so much computing is done online. Making your resources available via the internet is a likely requirement in almost all commercial aspects of computing. Equally important is ensuring that your users have a good experience, and designing a stylish, friendly and effective site is vital to useability and repeat visits.</p>
                <p>Also useful has been the history of the internet. From the origins of ARPANET to the modern day W3C organisation, this has provided excellent context to understanding how the web evolved, how it works, and why standards exist. Additionally, this allows me to expand my skills by knowing where to look for up to date standards and resources when coming across HTML and CSS that I am not familiar with. So far MDN has proved an excellent resource, which I look forwards to utilising in future for other technologies.</p>
                <h4>Introductory Programming</h4>
                <p>The different concepts presented, such as iterators, variables and conditionals are the basis of programming. Learning Python and JavaScript in CMT120 will make good use of this knowledge, especially due to the language agnostic nature of the material. I now understand that we should not start writing code immediately, but understand and solve any problem first before implementing it. Being able to write pseudocode and flowcharts, while thinking through any issues first will help my approach to programming. I will certainly use these methods in CMT120, and indeed future programming.</p>
                <p>Using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Command Line and Git Bash to host a webpage on the local port is also important. Maximising their potential can be a time saver for a large number of problems, and I look forward to utilising new tools and better understanding their purpose as I expand my computing skills.</p>
                <h4>Number Systems</h4>
                <p>An overview of different representations of numbers, and systems for interpreting them will be an asset in understanding better how computers process and interpret data. I was particularly excited by the ideas underpinning the Two's Complement system. Using mathematics to expand the available numbers we can represent in binary fascinated me. I hope to come across more examples of using mathematics to enhance computing in future.</p>
                <h4>Computational Thinking</h4>
                <p>The most widely applicable part of this module has been learning how to think computationally. During my studies and beyond I will surely encounter difficulties that I will not be able to overcome, and will now know how to approach them in a structured way. CT will be a very effective starting point for any obstacles encountered when using computers. In the past, I would have been greatly helped by a formal understanding of CT, including my Mathematics degree and my previous career as a Systems Analyst.</p>
                <p>Recognising that humans and machines have different strengths, CT allows us to take advantage of both, creating solutions that would have been unimaginable otherwise. I am very keen to use these methods in my future studies and use CT to tackle new and challenging problems, and explore further what challenges we can solve through a study of computing.</p>
